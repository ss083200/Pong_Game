# Pong_Game
Classic 2-player Pong Game implemented in Python using Turtle graphics. Control paddles, volley the ball, and compete against a friend to score points in this retro arcade game.

This repository contains a 2-player Pong Game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics module. Experience the excitement of the classic arcade game as two players control their paddles to volley a ball back and forth, aiming to score points against each other.

The main.py file serves as the entry point of the game. It sets up the game window, initializes the paddles, ball, and scoreboard. Keyboard inputs are listened to control the paddles for both players. The game loop continuously updates the screen, moves the ball, and detects collisions with walls and paddles. The score is tracked, and points are awarded when the ball passes the opponent's paddle.

This implementation follows an object-oriented approach, utilizing classes such as paddle.py for the paddle behavior, ball.py for the ball's movement and collision detection, and scoreboard.py to track and display the score.

Enjoy the competitive nature of Pong as you compete against a friend or family member. This project not only offers an engaging gaming experience but also provides an opportunity to learn Python programming and explore the fundamentals of object-oriented design. Let the Pong matches begin!
